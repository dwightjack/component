# devtools

`devtools` is an helper function that will expose the instance of a Component in a `$yuzu` property attached to its root DOM element.

It will also extend every Component instance with some useful methods.

!> To improve performance in production, this property and its methods will be available just when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

To initialize the devtools copy the following code into your entry point:

```js
import { Component, devtools } from 'yuzu';

devtools(Component);
```

# Component

Methods and properties added by devtools

## $el.$yuzu

A reference to a Component instance attached to its root element.

## $$logStart

```js
$$logStart([label], [event])
```

Will initialize an event logger with a custom label. By default will automatically log any change to the instance `state` property.

?> Note that event loggers will be not available until the instance is initialized

### Parameters

-   `label` **[string][1]?** Log label. If not defined will fallback to: A `debugLabel` option, a static `displayName` property defined on the constructor, the component name
-   `listen` **([string][1] \| [boolean][2])** Event to listen for or `false`. (optional, default `"change:*"`)

## $$logEnd

```js
$$logEnd([event])
```

Will stop an event logger either for a specific event or for every event.

### Parameters

-   `event` **[string][1]?** Event to unsubscribe for. If not provided the logger will be completely stopped and removed
